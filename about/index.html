			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I am a recent college graduate with experience kickstarting and managing global projects in education, urbanism, trade, and public policy. </p>
			<p>After working in European Parliament and for the Executive Office of the President, volunteering on four continents for an international NGO, conducting research in a dozen countries and founding a handful of grassroots community development initiatives, I received a Fulbright Scholarship to coordinate educational programs and implement public diplomacy initiatives in Southeast Asia. </P>
			<p>I am recognized by my managers and peers as a leader, designer, innovator and lover of efficiency. I am experienced in program design, conflict resolution, event planning, leadership development, communication strategy, stakeholder affairs, grassroots advocacy and research.</p>
			<p>I enjoy 35mm photography, experimenting in the kitchen and learning about flags</p>
